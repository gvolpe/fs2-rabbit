# Publishers

Publishing are blocking actions in the underlying Java client so you need to pass in a [`cats.effect.Blocker`](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/concurrency/basics.html#choosing-thread-pool) when creating the `RabbitClient` client.

- **[Publisher](./publisher.html)**: A simple message publisher.
- **[Publisher with Listener](./publisher-with-listener.html)**: A publisher with a listener for messages that can not be routed.
- **[Publishing Json](./json.html)**: Publishing Json messages using the `fs2-rabbit-circe` module.
